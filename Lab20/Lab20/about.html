    <p>
        Student at Grand Circus Coding Scool
        I am a current student at Grand Circus, and will be graduating June 29, 2018.
        I am a graduate of Grand Valley State University, where i earned a BS in Natural Resource Management, while also competing as a three year letterman in Wrestling.
        Time Management was key with a busy schedule, class load, and travel for competitions, and has helped me develop a good work ethic.
        I currently reside in Royal Oak, MI.
