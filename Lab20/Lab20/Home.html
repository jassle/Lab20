    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <h1>You have reached Jason Leonard's Website</h1>
   <p>Thank you for visiting my site. I am currently a student at Grand Circus coding school in the .Net C# program.
    I have always been fascinated with how software and websites work, and I have to say that i really enjoy learning about the different aspects.
    Please feel free to check out my portfolio, and follow the links to my Git Hub account or my Linked In profile.

   <h2>Developer Goals</h2>
   <p>As a developer, my goal is to work with Virtual Reality applications. Many businesses are starting to use Virtual Reality(VR) as a useful asset.
    Medical professions can use VR to educate and train students or new employee. CT and MRI training are both available on Steam for use with the HTC Vive.
    Architects and builders are building simulations for clients to tour projects in the design phase so that they, can approve or make changes before the project starts.
    Public Safety Programs can use software applications to train Police and Fire Fighters to prepare them for real life situations.
    OSHA training is also available for skilled trades. With the current technology, you can truely feel fully submersed in your environment. 
    The possibilities are endless, and this technology will soon begin to grow rapidly. My passion is to be a part of the future of VR.

    <h2>My hometown of Royal Oak, MI</h2>
    <p>Royal Oak, Michigan is home to a lot of great venues for both dining and entertainment. Reataurants like Ale Mary's, The Morrie, Ronin, and Hopcat are just a 
    handful of place Royal Oak has to offer. If you are looking for entertainment, there is Mark Ridley's Comedy Castle, Emagine Theatres, Royal Oak Music Theatre, 526 Piano bar, 
    and is also home to Arts, Beats and Eats over Labor Day Weekend. Thursday night is bike night, where bikers come from all over Metro Detroit to show off their Iron Horse along
    Main St. It is definitely a place to plan an evening the next time you want to get out on the town.</p>
